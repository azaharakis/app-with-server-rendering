# app-with-server-rendering
A basic application that demonstrates server side rendering. 
Each individual commit has purposefully been crafted to explain the new code that's added and its purpose
within the application.

## Requirements
- [Node js (7.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)

## Optional Requirements
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) Node version manager
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) An alternative to NPM

NVM is a version manager for node which is a good option if you don't have node installed use NVM:

For a smoother experience with package management it is ideal to use `yarn`over NPM
`npm install -g yarn`

## Prior to starting the application
`npm install` or `yarn`

## Run the application
`npm run start` or `yarn start`

## Develop the application
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
This will restart the server and recompile the client side assets whenever a file has been changed
within the project

## Linting and Testing
`npm run lint` or `yarn lint`
